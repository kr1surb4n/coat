* coat

so coat is a set of scripts to help you work with the cli.
the idea is to use change the experience into playing a MUD
game. the less typing the better. and use of the shell has to
be like walking and having a coat that is putting itself on you
without interfering you as you walk. shell should not slow down
your momentum.
